### Hellooooooooo!

My name is Faye(she/her). I'm a front end developer, working primarily in SASS/CSS/SCSS, custom WordPress templating, and I specalize in website accessibility. Also I am super hilarious.

If you're looking for code samples, I typically use [Cacher](https://snippets.cacher.io/user/FayeDM) to host those, since I've always worked in collaboration with a team and my work comes in smaller contributions than entire projects.
